 JavaScript has two types of scopes:
  1)Global scope
  2)Local scope -- Local scope variables are divided into : a)Function Scope
                                                            b)Blocked Scope.
 
  * Before ES6 (2015), JavaScript had only Global Scope and Function Scope where we using Var Keyword.
  * ES6 introduced two important new JavaScript keywords: let and const.
  * These two keywords provide Block Scope in JavaScript.
  
  The var keyword is used to declare function-scoped variables and globally-scoped variables.
  var x = 2; // Global Scope 
  if (x === 2) {
  var x = 3;  //Function Scope
  console.log(x); // expected output: 3
   }

  console.log(x);
  
 # The main difference between keywords var and let is that variables declared using let are block-scoped, while var is function scoped.
 # let is Block-Scoped.
 var a = 20;
 {
  let exe = 30;
  console.log(exe); // Expected output: 30
 }
 console.log(a) // Expected output: 20
 console.log(exe); // Uncaught ReferenceError: exe is not defined

 ^ Using the const keyword lets you declare constants that cannot be changed later once youâ€™ve declared them.
 const a=5;
 const pi = 3.14;
 pi = 1.5; // Uncaught TypeError: Assignment to constant variable.
 
 
 conclusion  
  var -- Function Scoped and globally Scope. 
  let -- Block-scope
  const -- cannot changes once you declared.
